## No longer supported
I'm no longer using this and was notified it doesn't work with heroku's latest stack. I'm sure it'd be really simple to get it to work. I just don't care since I'm not using it.


## How to use
Change the last line of config.ru to your host: `run App.new("http://tjsingleton.name")`
